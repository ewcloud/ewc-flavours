# SSH bastion flavour

This repository contains a configuration template
(i.e. an [Ansible Playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks.html))
to customize your environment in the
[European Weather Cloud (EWC)](https://europeanweather.cloud/).

The template is designed to:

* Configure pre-existing RockyLinux 8 or RockyLinux 9 virtual machines (with
public IP address), as entrypoint for users who wish to reach private
EWC networks from the public internet via SSH.

## Usage

### 1. Specify the target host and SSH credentials
Create an inventory file to specify address/credentials that Ansible should use
to reach the virtual machine you wish to configure:

```yaml
# inventory.yml
---
ewcloud:
  hosts:
    ssh_bastion:
      ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3
      ansible_host: <add the IPV4 address of the target host>
      ansible_ssh_private_key_file: <add the path to local SSH RSA private key file>
      ansible_user: <add the username which owns the SSH RSA private key >

```

### 2. Configure and apply the template

#### 2.1. Interactive Mode

By running the following command, you can trigger an interactive session that
prompts you for the necessary user inputs, and then applies changes to your
target EWC environment:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml ssh-bastion-flavour.yml
```

#### 2.2. Non-Interactive Mode

>ðŸ’¡ To learn more about defining variables at runtime, checkout the
[official Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_variables.html).

You can also run in non-interactive mode by passing the
`--extra-vars` or `-e` flag, followed by a `"<input name>=<input value>"` key-value pair.
The flag and its follow up key-value pair must be set for each and every input ([see inputs section below](#inputs)):
```bash
ansible-playbook \
  -i inventory.yml \
  -e whitelisted_ip_ranges_override=['10.0.0.0/24'] \
  ssh-bastion-flavour.yml
```

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|----------|
| whitelisted_ip_ranges_override | IPv4 ranges (in CIDR format) to be whitelisted in Fail2ban configuration. Example: `['10.0.0.0/24']` | `list(string)` | n/a | no |
